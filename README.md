# Experimental extension notice
> Tailwind 4 Palette is **an experimental extension**. It uses the theme variables introduced in beta-2025-11. There is no guarantee that this theme will function like expected, and no support is provided. This extension solely adjusts the Pterodactyl color palette and nothing else.

---

## What's this theme?
Tailwind 4 Palette is, pretty much, what it sounds like. It brings the [color palette introduced in Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) over to your Pterodactyl panel.

## Why is this experimental?
Blueprint recently introduced a feature that allows extensions to make adjustments to the Pterodactyl color palette directly. It seems to different results depending on minor differences in Pterodactyl and Blueprint installations, and might break or not apply on certain panels.

## How does it look?
